# Fraudulent_Claim_Detection
**Overview**
Global Insure processes thousands of insurance claims annually, facing substantial financial losses due to fraudulent submissions. The existing manual fraud detection system is inefficient and often identifies fraud only after approvals, resulting in delayed responses and missed opportunities for prevention.

This project aims to leverage historical claims data and customer profiles to develop a predictive model that accurately classifies claims as fraudulent or legitimate. By identifying suspicious patterns and high-risk indicators early in the process, the model enables proactive detection, reduces financial losses, and enhances operational efficiency.

**Project Goal (Summary)**
Develop a predictive model that leverages historical insurance claim data to detect fraudulent claims early, reduce financial losses, and improve the efficiency of the fraud detection process.

**Project Objectives (Summary)**
Detect Patterns: Analyze past claim data to identify trends linked to fraud.

Assess Feature Importance: Determine which features (e.g., claim amount, customer profile) are most indicative of fraud.

Predict Fraud: Build a model to estimate the likelihood of fraud in new claims.

Improve Processes: Use insights from the model to enhance and streamline the current fraud detection system.
